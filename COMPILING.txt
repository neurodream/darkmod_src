=== Additional info about building the static 32-bit library libcurl ===

Download the libcurl 7.21 source package, and extract it on your system, then run the following commands:

 env CFLAGS="-m32" LDFLAGS="-m32" ./configure --disable-ldap --build=i686-unknown-linux-gnu --without-libidn --without-zlib
 make
 sudo make install

The library is then located in /usr/local/lib/libcurl.a.
Copy that to darkmod_src/linux/libcurl/

=== Building Boost static libs in Mac OS X ===

Download the boost 1.57 sources and extract them to your hard drive. Build the b2 utility using bootstrap, replacing /Users/greebo/ with your home folder:

 ./bootstrap.sh --prefix=/Users/greebo/boost-1.57

Then build the static libraries one by one, we need these:

 filesystem
 program_options
 regex
 system
 thread

The b2 command that built the 32 bit libraries against the 10.6 SDK worked for me is the one below.
Note that you'll need to download the 10.6 SDK from somewhere to be able to build against that:

 b2 cxxflags="-arch i386 -mmacosx-version-min=10.6 -isysroot /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.6.sdk" address-model=32 architecture=x86 link=static release [stage]

The "stage" option only works in some libraries (not in thread, as of boost 1.57). You'll find the filesystem and system libs in
the ./stage folder of the current directory, the libboost_thread.a will be located in the bin.v2 folder after compilation, like this:

 ./bin.v2/libs/thread/build/darwin-4.2.1/release/address-model-32/architecture-x86/link-static/threading-multi/libboost_thread.a

Copy all libboost*.a files to darkmod_src/macosx/boost/lib/.
